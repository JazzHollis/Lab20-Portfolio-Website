    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Detroit based artist with a passion for any and everything design
        related, whether it be a website, a magazine or logo. If it involves design,
        I'm usually taking a peek at the end result and breaking down the process in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have a deep love for the tradional arts. I currently am working on a few oil painting projects. Portraits are my favorite!
        The human body is one of the greatest things that God has ever created in my opinion, and I'm always on awe of the Creator's ability to capture
    </p>
    <p>
        As a native Detroiter I can't help but to love music! From the local Detroit music festivals where I embarked on journeys back to the era of Motown to the rythmic and melodious
        sounds of John Coltrane, Gregory Porter and many others at the Detroit Jazz Festival!
